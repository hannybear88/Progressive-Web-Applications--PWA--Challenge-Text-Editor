# Progressive-Web-Applications--PWA--Challenge-Text-Editor
HW CHALLENGE #19


## Description
So far, we have completed multiple projects, our task is to create a portfolio, using our new React skills to help set us apart from other developers whose portfolios donâ€™t use the latest technologies.

To build this text editor,we will start with an existing application and implement methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database. We will use a package called `idb`, which is a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API. It features a number of methods that are useful for storing and retrieving data, and is used by companies like Google and Mozilla. [click here](https://github.com/hannybear88/Progressive-Web-Applications--PWA--Challenge-Text-Editor/tree/main/client/src/js) to see my code for this project.

## Installation
* This text editor require a number of methods and store data to an IndexedDB database to be builded up.

* This application will require the installation of Node.js and various npm packages.

*   Node Package Manager (npm) is a software manager and installer which puts the modules in place so that the node project can utilize it, and also, it manages dependency conflicts intelligently and initialized using **npm init**. The package.json will be generated and will contains all the details of the application in which the user have inputted during the npm initialization. 

*  This application will use the following npm packages:-

    * npm install express (express.js)
    * npm install --save-dev webpack (Webpack)
    * npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev (webpack-dev-server)
    * npm install --save-dev webpack-pwa-manifest (WebpackPwaManifest)
    * npm install babel (Babel)
    * npm install --save-dev css-loader (CSS-loader)
    * npm install concurrently --save (run multiple commands concurrently.) (Concurrently)
    * npm npm install idb (IndexedDB)

* The required modules are bundled in the package.json file and at CLI or integrated terminal type in **npm run install**, the modules will be installed.

## User Story
- AS A developer
- I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
- SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use


## Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN a text editor web application
- WHEN I open my application in my editor
- THEN I should see a client server folder structure
- WHEN I run `npm run start` from the root directory
- THEN I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client
- WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal
- THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack
- WHEN I run my webpack plugins
- THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file
- WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application
- THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors
- WHEN I open the text editor
- THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage
- WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window
- THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB
- WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it
- THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB
- WHEN I click on the Install button
- THEN I download my web application as an icon on my desktop
- WHEN I load my web application
- THEN I should have a registered service worker using workbox
- WHEN I register a service worker
- THEN I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets
- WHEN I deploy to Heroku
- THEN I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application
